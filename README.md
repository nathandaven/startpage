This repository includes my API key. The API key is attached to a dummy account, however please refrain from using it. This repo is made specifically for my use case, but feel free to use this as a base if interested. Please change the API key by following the documentation here: https://github.com/nathandaven/startpage.

Firefox extension is compiled and signed using web-ext. Please read the documentation on web-ext if you are interested in creating and signing your own version of this project.
